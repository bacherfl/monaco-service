## Supporting Monaco Folder Structure
In the initial release of the monaco-service it was mandatory to create a zip archive containing the monaco folder structure with all configuration files.
With this release we support the regular folder structure as part of your Keptn Configuration Repo. Simply upload your projects folder, sub projects and configuration folders as you would do when using monaco standalone.
Have a look at the readme for an example

## Updating to Monaco CLI 1.1.0
This release also upgrades the monaco CLI that is installed in this container to version 1.1.0 which is the current version as of this release
